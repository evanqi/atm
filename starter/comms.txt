Username Validation:

Bank sends "yes" or "no"

Withdraw:
Atm sends "w <username> 0 <amt>"
Bank sends "yes" or "nofunds"

ENCRYPTION TODO:
- bank needs to prove that it is sending the responses (MAC or signing)
    - maybe send something else along with "yes" or "no" to prove?
- atm needs to prove that commands sent are legit (MAC or signing)
    - send something only atm and bank would know?
- symmetric encryption between bank and atm?
    - no asymmetric because can't find docs online for RSA
